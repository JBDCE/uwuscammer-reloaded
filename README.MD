# UwU Scammer Reloaded

This is a rebuild of my 2020 one-night code project based on a YouTube thumbnail, updated for 2025.

The idea is a simple phishing front end in which an anime character politely asks the user for their credit card information.

The original project was implemented as a Java Swing application, as this was the front-end with which I was most comfortable at the time.

This project aims to implement the same algorithms and logic, but with a web front page designed around Django.
The target resolution will therefore be 1080p, using whatever fancy UI libraries and animations I can come up with.

For starting out I will loosely follow the Django Youtube Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0roB7wZMLqI


Update: After i while i got fedup with the restrictions of djangos restrictions 
i pivot to fastapi using their reccomended tech stack. 
Now loosely following the tutorial: https://www.fastapitutorial.com/blog/fastapi-course/ and https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial
